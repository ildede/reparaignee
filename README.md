Have you ever thought about how tiring and stressful can a spider's life be? I bet you didn't. Time to try for yourself! RéparAignée, (SpideRepair, or RipaRagna), is a game about trying to keep your spiderweb safe and fixing lines that keep getting destroyed by every sort of bug. And about pleasing the local boss. You don't want to mess with her.
